- Key competitors: Station, Shift, Citrix Workspace, ClickUp, Notion.
- Opportunity: True multi-tool integration + AI summarization + performance focus.

### 💰 Business Model
- Freemium → Team → Business → Enterprise.
- Pricing based on # of connected tools and team size.
- Long-term: API marketplace for third-party integrations.

## 🧠 2. Personas & Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### 🧑‍💻 Tech Lead (Sam)
- Goal: Track commits, PRs, and Jira tickets in one view.
- Pain: Switching tools slows deep work, kills focus.

### 🎨 Designer (Maya)
- Goal: Stay updated on Figma comments and new Jira tasks.
- Pain: Notifications scattered across Slack, Figma, email.

### 🧑‍💼 Manager (Luca)
- Goal: Understand project status and team blockers quickly.
- Pain: Hard to track progress across disconnected tools.

## 📋 3. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 🎯 Core Use Cases
- Unified feed of updates from connected tools.
- Spotlight-style cross-tool search.
- AI daily digest of all tool activity.
- Inline actions: reply, comment, close ticket, approve PR.

### ⚙️ Functional Requirements
- OAuth integration for tools (Slack, Notion, Jira, Figma, GitHub).
- Real-time sync engine.
- Search index across all tools.
- Role-based access and org management.

### ⚡ Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast loading (<2s feed load)
- Secure (OAuth2, encrypted tokens, GDPR compliant)
- Scalable (multi-tenant architecture)

### 📈 Success Metrics
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Connected tools per user
- Time saved per user/day
- Team activation rate

## 🗺 5. UX + System Design

### 🧩 Information Architecture
- Dashboard (feed + search + digest)
- Tool integrations (settings)
- Notifications panel
- Profile / Org Management

### 🎨 UX Artifacts
- User journey: Onboarding → Connect tools → See feed → Take action
- Wireframes (Figma)
- Clickable prototype

### ⚙️ System Architecture
- Connectors Layer: OAuth + API polling/webhooks for each tool  
- Sync Engine: Normalizes data from each tool  
- Data Store: MongoDB / Postgres + Search index (Elastic/Lucene)  
- AI Layer: Summarizer → GPT model  
- Frontend: React/Next.js app  
- Backend: Node.js/Express with GraphQL or REST API

### 📐 Data Model Draft
- User (id, email, org_id, tokens)  
- Organization (id, name, members)  
- Connection (user_id, tool, access_token, scopes)  
- Item (id, type, content, tool, created_at, updated_at)  
- Feed (user_id, item_ids[])
